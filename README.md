# The-Ledger-Co
The Ledger Co., a marketplace for banks to lend money to borrowers and receive payments for the loans. The interest for the loan is calculated by I = P*N*R where P is the principal amount, N is the number of years and R is the rate of interest. The total amount to repay will be A = P + I The amount should be paid back monthly in the form of EMIs. The borrowers can also pay a lump sum (that is, an amount more than their monthly EMI). In such a case, the lump sum will be deducted from the total amount (A) which can reduce the number of EMIs. This doesnâ€™t affect the EMI amount unless the remaining total amount is less than the EMI. All transactions happen through The Ledger Co.
